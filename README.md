# XCode Suite (ARCHIVED)

> **Status:** ARCHIVED - Superseded by AnkrCode

## Deprecation Notice

This repository has been **archived** as of January 2026. This was an early scaffold that has been superseded by AnkrCode and the ANKR Labs monorepo.

### Successor Projects:

| Old Package | New Location | Status |
|-------------|--------------|--------|
| xcodebox-core | `@ankr/ankrcode-core` | Rebuilt |
| memobox-memory | `@ankr/eon` | Rebuilt |
| mcpbox-web | `ankr-labs-nx` | Integrated |

### Where to go now:

- **Main Monorepo:** [github.com/rocketlang/ankr-labs-nx](https://github.com/rocketlang/ankr-labs-nx)
- **AnkrCode:** [github.com/rocketlang/ankrcode](https://github.com/rocketlang/ankrcode)
- **EON Memory:** `ankr-labs-nx/packages/ankr-eon`

### Original Purpose

XCode Suite was an early scaffold for:

- CLI tools (xcodebox-core)
- Memory system (memobox-memory)
- MCP web interface (mcpbox-web)
- File watcher daemon

All functionality has been rebuilt with proper implementations in the main monorepo.
